# AUTO_-WHATSAPP-MESSENGER
This project is made incase you don't have your device to message someone at a specific time. Such as someone's birthday at 12:00am. This project enables you to automate the sending of the WhatsApp message. You just leave your computer on and specify how many hours later you want the message to be sent.

To use this project simply install python, then add pyhton to your environment variables or you will not get access to the microphone
